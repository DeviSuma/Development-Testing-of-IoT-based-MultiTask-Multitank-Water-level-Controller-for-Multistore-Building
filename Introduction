In the modern era, the sustainable management of resources has become paramount, especially in densely populated urban areas where the demand for water is exponentially increasing. Multi storied buildings, with their complex infrastructure and numerous occupants, often face challenges in efficiently managing water levels and preventing overflow incidents. The consequences of such mismanagement not only include wastage of precious resources but also lead to infrastructural damage, inconvenience to residents, and increased energy consumption. To address these challenges, a multitask water level controller with automated power supply for multi storied buildings, employing IoT technology accessible through mobile devices, is proposed.The two primary objectives of this project are to prevent water wastage due to overflow incidents and to optimize power consumption associated with water pumping operations. By employing a single motor for water pumping and providing separate billing for individual units, the system encourages responsible usage among occupants while ensuring equitable distribution and efficient management of water resources. Furthermore, the integration of IoT technology enables real-time monitoring, remote control, and predictive analytics, allowing building managers to proactively address potential issues before they escalate. This project not only addresses the immediate challenges of water wastage and energy consumption but also lays the foundation for a more sustainable and resilient water management system in multi storied buildings and promote smarter and more sustainable urban living.Many literatures have discussed about the automated water level controller and billing system which ensures the efficient usage of water and power.  Balachandra C et al. designed developed and analyzed the water level in the tank and motor switching status to obtain the result and conclusion for the proposed model. The designed multi-task water level controller is major key aspect for filling multiple tanks. The developed model proves to major success for billing and monitoring the water level [1]. Danesh Hadimani et al. presented the development and implementation of IOT based Water Level Controller for Overhead Water Tank. They also designed the automatic water tank level mechanism to control the level of water quantity in the tank and also monitor the levels of water in main tank and sump tank through android application [2]. S. Wadekar et al. presents a smart water management using IoT device which help to manage and plan the usage of water. In this sensor wires in the overhead tank will detect the level of water. It shows that when a particular water level sensor senses the corresponding water level, data is sent to the microcontroller in the Simu-link CC3200 Wi-Fi Module, it will upload the corresponding level of water on the cloud. This data will be fetched by the android application and will be displayed to the end user [3]. Priya J and Sailusha Chekuri designed a water level monitoring system using IoT. The liquid level is highlighted as colored to show the level of liquid present in the container with the help of a web page to the user. The buzzer starts ringing when the set limit of the liquid is crossed. Thus this system helps to prevent the wastage of water by informing about the liquid levels of the containers [4]. M. S. Godwin Premi et al. designed an automatic water tank level and pump control system, which ensures several benefits. The sensor devices used in the system detects and controls the water level in the overhead tank and even in the pump. The sensor senses the levels and sends different signals to the Arduino and the signals are used for switching ON and OFF the motor pump as per requirements. The Arduino will control the pump by preventing it from dry running [5]. Tanver Rahman et al. has presented automated household water supply monitoring and billing system. The main feature of this project is automatic switching of the DC water motor based on the level of water present in reservoir along with display of the amount of water used in each block. For the display, an LCD Alphanumeric display was used. We have also included a set capacity of usage for each floor and billing according to usage [6]. Michael o. et al. presented the design and construction of a microcontroller based water level controller. This project was designed using the Atmega 328p microcontroller, which acts as the control unit for the system. The setup monitors the water level and triggers the relay which then triggers the pump, either OFF or ON for high or low water levels respectively [7]. Mallikarjun Hudedmani et al. designed flexible automatic water level controller and indicator, where this project does not use any microcontrollers. The operation of water level controller is based on the fact that water conducts electricity. As the water level rises or fall the sensing probes and circuits of the controller detect the same. These signals are used to switch ON or switch OFF the pump motor as per requirements. This system is used to automate the process of water pumping to over-head tank storage and has the facility to select the level of water to pump [8]. Lena C. A. et al. published research article resilient layout, design and operation of energy efficient water distribution networks for high rise buildings. Water supply of high-rise buildings requires pump systems to ensure pressure requirements. The design goals of these systems are energy and cost efficiency, both in terms of fixed cost as well as during operation. In this paper, cost optimal decentralized and tree-shaped water distribution networks are computed, where placements of pumps at different locations in the building are allowed [9]. Shih-Lun Chen presented an intelligent water monitoring iot system for ecological environment and smart cities. To create a sustainable urban and ecological environment, a water level and water quality control system implementing artificial intelligence is presented in this research. The proposed smart monitoring system consists of four sensors (two different liquid level sensors, a turbidity and pH sensor, and a water oxygen sensor), a control module (an MCU, a motor, a pump, and a drain), and a power and communication system (a solar panel, a battery, and a wireless communication module). The system focuses on low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) devices along with low power consumption and high precision [10]. S. M. Khaled Reza et al. presented microcontroller based automated water level sensing and controlling. In this paper introduced the notion of water level monitoring and management within the context of electrical conductivity of the water. More specifically, investigate the microcontroller based water level sensing and controlling in a wired and wireless environment. Water Level management approach would help in reducing the home power consumption and as well as water overflow. Furthermore, it can indicate the amount of water in the tank that can support Global Water types including cellular data loggers, satellite data transmission systems for remote water monitoring system. Moreover, cellular phones with relative high computation power and high quality graphical user interface became available recently. Finally, we proposed a web and cellular based monitoring service protocol would determine and senses water level globally [11]. Md. Raquibul Hasan et al. proposed "Design of Automatic Water Level Controlling System,‚Äù which presents a comprehensive exploration into the development of an innovative solution for managing water levels. The paper likely delves into the increasing significance of efficient water resource management in various sectors, such as agriculture, industrial processes, and domestic consumption. Additionally, his research may include practical implementation aspects, such as sensor technologies, control algorithms, and feedback mechanisms, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed system. Overall, the thesis likely contributes valuable insights and solutions to the ongoing global challenge of water resource management [12]. Shoeb S. Sheikh and Prof. S. Sharma presented an implementation methodology for a wireless automatic meter reading system (WAMRS) incorporating the widely used GSM network. Using GSM as the medium for WAMRS provides a cost-effective, ireless, always-connected, two-way data link between utility company and WAMRS, the WAMRS sends information of utility usage, power quality and outage alarm to utility company, tampering detection to the utility servers. In this paper it is also suggested that a method where we utilize telecommunication systems for automated transmission of data to facilitate bill generation at the server end and also to the customer via SMS, Email [13].
