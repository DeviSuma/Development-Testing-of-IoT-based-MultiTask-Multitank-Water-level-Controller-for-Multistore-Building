 Outcome of the Proposed Project: 
After the completion of the project, the following outcomes were obtained: 
➢ Generation of an automated electricity bills for respective individuals on power 
consumption for pumping individual overhead tanks
➢ Transparency in billing mechanism and water distribution is attained with monitoring 
through microcontroller system
➢ Auto-Switching (ON/OFF) of motor to avoid water overflow through contractor switch 
thereby achieving the water conservation and energy savings 
➢ The proposed mechanism can be extended to existing buildings with multiple tanks 
and multiple number of switching scenarios.

Conclusion:
After the conduction of tests under different constraints for the project, the following 
conclusion is obtained: 
• The miniature model is designed and installed successfully. 
• Performance testing is taken up in Energy Park with 3 tanks.
• Experimental results revealed that meter associated with respective valve will get 
connected for billing and other meters remain isolated. 
• The concept proves to be successful and much needed for the well existed multistoried 
buildings.
