# Development-Testing-of-IoT-based-MultiTask-Multitank-Water-level-Controller-for-Multistore-Building
The project aims to address the challenge of water distribution and electricity billing in multi-storied buildings in secondary cities like Bagalkote where smart metering of water supply is lacking. Through an IoT based system integrated with mobile apps and automated valves, residents can remotely monitor and control water usage.
Based on the field visits to residential area and discussions with owners of the rented buildings following objectives are set for the project :
To develop the multi-task, multi-tank water level controller with automated valve
To design the multi-task, multi-tank water level controller through IoT based system
To test and analyse the performance of proposed model in a multi store residential building having multiple tanks.
